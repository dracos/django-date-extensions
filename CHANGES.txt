Version 3.1.2

This version removes a warning about from_db_value, thanks swizzlevixen.
Supports Django up to 3.2.

Version 3.1.1

This version fixes a bug with serialization, thanks jonancm.

Version 3.1

This version supports Django 1.11 to 3.1.

It also switches to a truthy check rather than only checking for None and '',
as something that may help fix e.g. situations with migrations containing
bytestrings.

Version 3.0

This version supports Django 1.11 to 2.2, and makes ApproximateDate Unicode
compatible.

Thanks to Frank Sachsenheim, Mark Phillips, and Aamir Adnan, and apologies to
all for the severe delay in this release.

Version 2.0

This includes updates to work with Django 1.10, and bring the custom field code
more in line with a modern setup. This has the side effect of working filtering
by python date or datetime.

I've done a major version bump as the ApproximateDateField instance will now
return "" rather than None for an empty date, which is much more preferable
because you always had to query empty dates using "", not None. Unlikely to
break anything, given this behaviour was basically buggy, but seemed safest.

I've also added better testing via tox, and fixed any flake8 issues.

Thanks to John Lehmann and Aamir Adnan for reporting/tests.


Version 1.1

This version adds support for comparing ApproximateDate & date/datetime, and
factors out settings to enable them to be overridden.

Thanks to Baptiste Mispelon and jellevandehaterd for their contributions.


Version 1.0

First release. Thanks to Edmund von der Burg, Mark Longair, and Sandro Nardi
for their contributions.
